**Overview:**
->Step #1: Detect the presence of a colored object using computer vision techniques.
->Step #2: Track the object as it moves around in the video frames, drawing its previous positions as it moves.
The outcome is a sshown in the video above.

**Completed By Sonakshi Chauhan**

**Data:** Either a video having object movements or your webcam for real-time detection

**Deliverables:** Object Detection and movement Tracking
